1.For the gap, all the techniques do not have significant difference.

2.For the running time, when the number of nodes equal to 50, all the techniques do not have significant difference; in the other two cases, PSO<TS<SAB<SAVF.

3.For the iterations with 1% improvement, when the number of nodes equal to 50, all the techniques do not have significant difference; in the other two cases, PSO<TS<SAB<SAVF.

Besides, I have ploted and tested the correlationship between speed and FCNF characteristic (e.g., density, gamma), but did not find useful imformation. The iterations with 1% improvement is not affected by the FCNF characteristic.
